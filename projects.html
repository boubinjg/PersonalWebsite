	<h3>DSpace Profile Module Capstone Project</h3>
	<h6><i>With Jake Macfarland, Bryan Kirsten, Cecil Wilson, and Dr. Bo Brinkman</i></h6> 
	   <div class="col-md-12">
		<p><font size="3">For my Senior Capstone at Miami University, I worked on a project for the Miami University Librarysystem. Scholarly Commons, a service run out of Miami University which indexes scholarly data and media generated by university scholars, assigned us to create a web app to store profile information for the scholars that generate this media. The Scholarly Commons team uses DSpace to store their data. Universities and other institutions across the world use DSpace for the storage, management, and dissemination of their open digital content. DSpace allows these institutions to host all types of media through online digital repositories. Many institutions use DSpace for hosting the scholarly work generated by their faculty and staff. While institutions can host scholarly work using DSpace, it may be useful to hold the biographical and contact information for the authors of such work, so interested students and potential collaborators may reach them. For our capstone project, we are creating a profile module for DSpace which will host personal and contact information for scholars who are associated a given DSpace instances institution. Our module works with DSpace's XMLUI user interface to post information such as scholars names, photos, research interests, social and professional networking information and more for interested parties to view. Our module allows for users to edit their profile, and indexes all profiles alphabetically for easy access.</p>

		</div>

		<p>We faced a number of challenges creating our profile module. DSpace uses a number of technologies that we were not familiar with. DSpace uses a number of apache products, (Tomcat, Ant, Maven, Cocoon), for managing large web applications. To modify the aspects we were familiar with (the Java backend, html/css/js front end, and relational database) we needed to learn and understand these tools. DSpace is also a fairly large application. It was originally published in the early 2000's and is on its 6th version. To create our profile module in such a way that it was completely integrated with DSpace, we had to understand DSpace's multi-layer theme and aspect system, and the capabilities DSpace already provides, as to not reinvent the wheel. DSpace's documentation leaves much to be desired. Most of DSpace's documentation is from version 1.1, and much more is nonexistant. To learn about the internals of DSpace, we had to do a lot of exploration. The unix grep command was employed liberaly.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually, we created a functional system to read in, store, and display scholar's profile data. Our app authenticates users with Miami's LDAP server, allows them to create and edit their page, link to academic and social media profiles, and displays their publications in the DSpace database using AJAX. Our project is currently being used by the Miami University library system and will soon be submitted to the open source community</font></p>

	<h3>Micro-language Compiler</h3>
	<h6><i>With John Crabill and Michelle Kojs</i></h6>
	  <div class="col-md-12">
	    <p><font size="3">For the course <i> CSE 474 Compiler Design</i> at Miami University, we had a semester long group project in which we created our own compiler. We wrote a lexer, parser, and compiler to translate a user-defined microlanguage into a runnable assembly file. The compiler is written in Python and compiles into MIPS. The language includes primitives like integers, bools, and strings. The compiler has operators for concatenation, boolean operations, basic math, and printing. The compiler has control flow in the form of while loops and if statements which are nestable. The compiler also includes more advanced features such as functions, pointers, global variables with static scoping, and recursion support.</p>
	     <div class="pull-right" style="float: right">
	       <img src="ProjectsImages/MLExample.png" alt="Language Example" height="543", width="329">
	     </div>
	<p>The language takes some syntactic influences from Pascal, and funtctional influences from C. In the example program to the see the "begin" and "end" tokens as one would see in Pascal, as well as the pascal assignment operator ":=". Like C, the language requires a main function which can be void. Variables specified by the dereference "~" operator are pointers. You can also take the address "&" of a variable. This simple program demonstrates some of the funtionalities of the language like pointer operations, I/O, control flow, and arithemtic. Many of the featuers are implemented in a way that may look verbose. Function calls such as "func foo2(&c) funed" on line 24 seem to have more tokens than necessary. These extra tokens are added to keep the language LL1.</p>
    
	<p>This was by far the most difficult project I ever worked on for an undergraduate course. The project took place over the entire semester, slowly building on the foundations we had laid in our previous submissions. On my github, the project is divided into sections. Each section has a new compiler with more features than the last. Part 8 incorporates all of the features described above.
